Apache::AuthenLDAP is designed to work with mod_perl and
Net::LDAP. This module authenticates a user against an LDAP
backend. It can be combined with Apache::AuthzLDAP to provide
LDAP authorization as well.

This module also handles password aging and expiration, allowing for
enforcement of local password policy.

See AuthenLDAP.pm pod for detailed documentation.
