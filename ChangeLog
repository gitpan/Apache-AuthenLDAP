	o  Deprecated generic variable naming in favor of
	   module specific to reduce potential conflict with
	   other auth modules: 
	      LDAPServer  -> AuthenLDAPServer
	      LDAPPort    -> AuthenLDAPPort
	      UidAttrType -> AuthenUidAttrType
           Original variable names are still accepted but will be removed
           on the next major release.
	o  Made release 0.60
